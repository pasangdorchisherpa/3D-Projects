# Fusion 360 CAD Practice Project

This repository contains a small set of mechanical parts and an assembly created in **Fusion 360** as a learning exercise in 3D design and parametric modeling.

---

## 📦 Parts Included
- Hex socket bolt
- Hexagonal base plate
- L-shaped bracket
- Assembled model using the above components

Each part was modeled from scratch to practice:
- Sketch constraints and parametric design
- Extrude, fillet, and hole features
- Assemblies and component alignment
- Clean, manufacturable geometry

---

## 🎥 Videos
Short MP4 videos are included to showcase:
- Individual part rotations
- Final assembly view

(See the videos below or download them from the repository.)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Autodesk Fusion
- Parametric modeling workflow
- Basic mechanical design principles

## 📚 Purpose
This project was created as a hands-on learning experience to improve CAD skills.
